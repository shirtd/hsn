# Homological Sensor Networks

## TODO

#### Functionality
* generate paths inside domain
    * compare with "bad" paths
* path types
    * cyclic
    * inside / outside domain
* animate paths
* command line environment
* ~~color paths~~
* ~~highlight selected paths~~

#### Efficiency
* parallelize
    * persistence
    * bottleneck
* ~~save experiments~~
* ~~only update simplex function value if changed~~
    * plot top-dim simplices only
        * only save function values on these simplices (speedup?)
    * patch collections? (more efficient triangle plotting)

#### Organization
* add noise to name or build metadata
* better function value assignments
